NOTE: This project should be used for authorized testing or educational purposes only. You are free to copy, modify and reuse the source code at your own risk.

This is a basic Windows-only keylogger in C++ for US standard keyboards.

If you are using a GMAIL account, you will need to change the settings to "Less Secure Apps" to allow python to send email to GMAIL.


Usage:
1) Open keylogger.py in compiler.
2) Compile and run keylogger.py.
3) Start typing 
4) The program will terminate after we press "esc" key.
5) Inspect log.txt
6) If you send the mail along with the attached log file just add your sender and receiver's mail-id and it will be automatically sent to the receiver's email.

Uses:
1) Security Testing: improving the protection against hidden key loggers
2) Business Administration: Monitor what employees are doing (with their consent)
3) School/Institutions: Track keystrokes and log banned words in a file
4) Personal Control and File Backup: Make sure no one is using your computer when you are away
5) Parental Control: Track what your children are doing
6) Self-analysis and assessment
